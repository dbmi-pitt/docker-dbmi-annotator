<h1><span class="Bold">WARNING</span></h1>
<p class="First">Serious neuropsychiatric events, including but not
limited to depression, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and
completed suicide have been reported in patients taking Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) for smoking
cessation. Some cases may have been complicated by the symptoms of
nicotine withdrawal in patients who stopped smoking. Depressed mood
may be a symptom of nicotine withdrawal. Depression, rarely
including suicidal ideation, has been reported in smokers
undergoing a smoking cessation attempt without medication. However,
some of these symptoms have occurred in patients taking Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) who continued to
smoke.</p>
<p>All patients being treated with Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) should be observed for
neuropsychiatric symptoms including changes in behavior, hostility,
agitation, depressed mood, and suicide-related events, including
ideation, behavior, and attempted suicide. These symptoms, as well
as worsening of pre-existing psychiatric illness and completed
suicide have been reported in some patients attempting to quit
smoking while taking Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release
Tablets, USP (SR) in the postmarketing experience. When symptoms
were reported, most were during treatment with Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR), but some were
following discontinuation of treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR). These events have occurred in
patients with and without pre-existing psychiatric disease; some
have experienced worsening of their psychiatric illnesses. Patients
with serious psychiatric illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, and major depressive disorder did not participate in the
pre-marketing studies of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release
Tablets, USP (SR).</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Advise patients and caregivers that the
patient should stop taking Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release
Tablets, USP (SR) and contact a healthcare provider immediately if
agitation, hostility, depressed mood, or changes in thinking or
behavior that are not typical for the patient are observed, or if
the patient develops suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior.</span>
In many postmarketing cases, resolution of symptoms after
discontinuation of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release
Tablets, USP (SR) was reported, although in some cases the symptoms
persisted; therefore, ongoing monitoring and supportive care should
be provided until symptoms resolve.</p>
<p>The risks of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR) should be weighed against the benefits of its use.
Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) has been
demonstrated to increase the likelihood of abstinence from smoking
for as long as 6 months compared to treatment with placebo. The
health benefits of quitting smoking are immediate and substantial.

<p><span class="Bold">Use in Treating Psychiatric
Disorders:</span></p>
<p>Although Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP
(SR) is not indicated for treatment of depression, it contains the
same active ingredient as the antidepressant medications
WELLBUTRIN<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>,
WELLBUTRIN SR<span class="Bold"><span class="Sup">®</span></span>,
and WELLBUTRIN XL<span class="Sup">®</span>. Antidepressants
increased the risk compared to placebo of suicidal thinking and
behavior (suicidality) in children, adolescents, and young adults
in short-term studies of major depressive disorder (MDD) and other
psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use of Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) or any other
antidepressant in a child, adolescent, or young adult must balance
this risk with the clinical need. Short-term studies did not show
an increase in the risk of suicidality with antidepressants
compared to placebo in adults beyond age 24; there was a reduction
in risk with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults aged 65
and older. Depression and certain other psychiatric disorders are
themselves associated with increases in the risk of suicide.
Patients of all ages who are started on antidepressant therapy
should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical
worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families
and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation
and communication with the prescriber. Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) is not approved for use in
pediatric patients. (See <a href=

<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacodynamics</span></h2>
<p class="First">Bupropion is a relatively weak inhibitor of the
neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, and does not
inhibit monoamine oxidase or the re-uptake of serotonin. The
mechanism by which Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release
Tablets, USP (SR) enhances the ability of patients to abstain from
smoking is unknown. However, it is presumed that this action is
mediated by noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic mechanisms.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section" data-sectioncode="43682-4"><a name=
"section-3.2" id="section-3.2"></a>
<h2><span class="Bold">Pharmacokinetics</span></h2>
<p class="First">Bupropion is a racemic mixture. The pharmacologic
activity and pharmacokinetics of the individual enantiomers have
not been studied. Bupropion follows biphasic pharmacokinetics best
described by a 2-compartment model. The terminal phase has a mean
half-life (±% CV) of about 21 hours (±20%), while the distribution
phase has a mean half-life of 3 to 4 hours.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Absorption:</span> Bupropion has not
been administered intravenously to humans; therefore, the absolute
bioavailability of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release
Tablets, USP (SR) in humans has not been determined. In rat and dog
studies, the bioavailability of bupropion ranged from 5% to
20%.</p>
<p>Following oral administration of Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) to healthy volunteers, peak
plasma concentrations of bupropion are achieved within 3 hours. The
mean peak concentration (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) values were
91 and 143 ng/mL from 2 single-dose (150-mg) studies. At steady
state, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span> following a 150-mg
dose every 12 hours is 136 ng/mL.</p>
<p>Exposure to bupropion may be increased when Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) are taken with
food. Three studies in healthy volunteers demonstrated peak plasma
concentrations (C<span class="Sub">max</span>) of bupropion
increased by 11% to 35% when administered with food, while overall
exposure (AUC) to bupropion increased by 16% to 19%. The food
effect is not considered clinically significant and Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) can be taken with
or without food.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Distribution:</span><span class=
"Italics">In vitro</span> tests show that bupropion is 84% bound to
human plasma proteins at concentrations up to 200 mcg/mL. The
extent of protein binding of the hydroxybupropion metabolite is
similar to that for bupropion, whereas the extent of protein
binding of the threohydrobupropion metabolite is about half that
seen with bupropion. The volume of distribution (V<span class=
"Sub">ss</span>/F) estimated from a single 150-mg dose given to 17
subjects is 1,950 L (20% CV).</p>
<p><a name="b1cc06a6-6017-4ad6-a87f-22f8c0ba791a" id=
"b1cc06a6-6017-4ad6-a87f-22f8c0ba791a"></a><span class=
"Bold Italics">Metabolism:</span> Bupropion is extensively
metabolized in humans. Three metabolites have been shown to be
active: hydroxybupropion, which is formed via hydroxylation of the
<span class="Italics">tert</span>-butyl group of bupropion, and the
amino-alcohol isomers threohydrobupropion and
erythrohydrobupropion, which are formed via reduction of the
carbonyl group. <span class="Italics">In vitro</span> findings
suggest that cytochrome P450IIB6 (CYP2B6) is the principal
isoenzyme involved in the formation of hydroxybupropion, while
cytochrome P450 isoenzymes are not involved in the formation of
threohydrobupropion. Oxidation of the bupropion side chain results
in the formation of a glycine conjugate of meta-chlorobenzoic acid,
which is then excreted as the major urinary metabolite. The potency
and toxicity of the metabolites relative to bupropion have not been
fully characterized. However, it has been demonstrated in an
antidepressant screening test in mice that hydroxybupropion is
one-half as potent as bupropion, while threohydrobupropion and
erythrohydrobupropion are 5-fold less potent than bupropion. This
may be of clinical importance because the plasma concentrations of
the metabolites are as high or higher than those of bupropion.</p>
<p>Because bupropion is extensively metabolized, there is the
potential for drug-drug interactions, particularly with those
agents that are metabolized by or which inhibit/induce the
cytochrome P450IIB6 (CYP2B6) isoenzyme, such as ritonavir or
efavirenz. In a healthy volunteer study, ritonavir at a dose of 100
mg twice daily reduced the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of
bupropion by 22% and 21%, respectively. The exposure of the
hydroxybupropion metabolite was decreased by 23%, the
threohydrobupropion decreased by 38%, and the erythrohydrobupropion
decreased by 48%.</p>
<p>In a second healthy volunteer study, ritonavir at a dose of 600
mg twice daily decreased the AUC and the C<span class=
"Sub">max</span> of bupropion by 66% and 62%, respectively. The
exposure of the hydroxybupropion metabolite was decreased by 78%,
the threohydrobupropion decreased by 50%, and the
erythrohydrobupropion decreased by 68%.</p>
<p>In another healthy volunteer study, KALETRA<span class=
"Sup">®</span> (lopinavir 400 mg/ritonavir 100 mg twice daily)
decreased bupropion AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> by 57%.
The AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of hydroxybupropion were
decreased by 50% and 31%, respectively (see <a href=
"#be1e9ff0-6587-48df-9ade-0d0288ac9f6e">PRECAUTIONS: Drug
Interactions</a>).</p>
<p>In a study in healthy volunteers, efavirenz 600 mg once daily
for 2 weeks reduced the AUC and C<span class="Sub">max</span> of
bupropion by approximately 55% and 34%, respectively. The AUC of
hydroxybupropion was unchanged, whereas C<span class=
"Sub">max</span> of hydroxybupropion was increased by 50%.</p>
<p>Although bupropion is not metabolized by cytochrome P450IID6
(CYP2D6), there is the potential for drug-drug interactions when
bupropion is coadministered with drugs metabolized by this
isoenzyme (see <a href=
"#be1e9ff0-6587-48df-9ade-0d0288ac9f6e">PRECAUTIONS: Drug
Interactions</a>).</p>
<p>Following a single dose in humans, peak plasma concentrations of
hydroxybupropion occur approximately 6 hours after administration
of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR). Peak
plasma concentrations of hydroxybupropion are approximately 10
times the peak level of the parent drug at steady state. The
elimination half-life of hydroxybupropion is approximately 20 (±5)
hours, and its AUC at steady state is about 17 times that of
bupropion. The times to peak concentrations for the
erythrohydrobupropion and threohydrobupropion metabolites are
similar to that of the hydroxybupropion metabolite; however, their
elimination half-lives are longer, 33 (±10) and 37 (±13) hours,
respectively, and steady-state AUCs are 1.5 and 7 times that of
bupropion, respectively.</p>
<p>Bupropion and its metabolites exhibit linear kinetics following
chronic administration of 300 to 450 mg/day.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Elimination:</span> The mean (±% CV)
apparent clearance (Cl/F) estimated from 2 single-dose (150-mg)
studies are 135 (±20%) and 209 L/hr (±21%). Following chronic
dosing of 150 mg of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release
Tablets, USP (SR) every 12 hours for 14 days (n = 34), the mean
Cl/F at steady state was 160 L/hr (±23%). The mean elimination
half-life of bupropion estimated from a series of studies is
approximately 21 hours. Estimates of the half-lives of the
metabolites determined from a multiple-dose study were 20 hours
(±25%) for hydroxybupropion, 37 hours (±35%) for
threohydrobupropion, and 33 hours (±30%) for erythrohydrobupropion.
Steady-state plasma concentrations of bupropion and metabolites are
reached within 5 and 8 days, respectively.</p>
<p>Following oral administration of 200 mg of <span class=
"Sup">14</span>C-bupropion in humans, 87% and 10% of the
radioactive dose were recovered in the urine and feces,
respectively. The fraction of the oral dose of bupropion excreted
unchanged was only 0.5%.</p>
<p>The effects of cigarette smoking on the pharmacokinetics of
bupropion were studied in 34 healthy male and female volunteers; 17
were chronic cigarette smokers and 17 were nonsmokers. Following
oral administration of a single 150-mg dose of Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR), there was no
statistically significant difference in C<span class=
"Sub">max</span>, half-life, T<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC, or
clearance of bupropion or its major metabolites between smokers and
nonsmokers.</p>
<p>In a study comparing the treatment combination of Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) and nicotine
transdermal system (NTS) versus Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) alone, no statistically
significant differences were observed between the 2 treatment
groups of combination Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release
Tablets, USP (SR) and NTS (n = 197) and Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) alone (n = 193) in the plasma
concentrations of bupropion or its active metabolites at weeks 3
and 6.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Population Subgroups:</span> Factors or
conditions altering metabolic capacity (e.g., liver disease,
congestive heart failure [CHF], age, concomitant medications, etc.)
or elimination may be expected to influence the degree and extent
of accumulation of the active metabolites of bupropion. The
elimination of the major metabolites of bupropion may be affected
by reduced renal or hepatic function because they are moderately
polar compounds and are likely to undergo further metabolism or
conjugation in the liver prior to urinary excretion.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Hepatic:</span> The effect of hepatic
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion was characterized
in 2 single-dose studies, one in patients with alcoholic liver
disease and one in patients with mild-to-severe cirrhosis. The
first study showed that the half-life of hydroxybupropion was
significantly longer in 8 patients with alcoholic liver disease
than in 8 healthy volunteers (32 ± 14 hours versus 21 ± 5 hours,
respectively). Although not statistically significant, the AUCs for
bupropion and hydroxybupropion were more variable and tended to be
greater (by 53% to 57%) in patients with alcoholic liver disease.
The differences in half-life for bupropion and the other
metabolites in the 2 patient groups were minimal.</p>
<p>The second study showed that there were no statistically
significant differences in the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and
its active metabolites in 9 patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic
cirrhosis compared to 8 healthy volunteers. However, more
variability was observed in some of the pharmacokinetic parameters
for bupropion (AUC, C<span class="Sub">max</span>, and
T<span class="Sub">max</span>) and its active metabolites (t½) in
patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic cirrhosis. In addition, in
patients with severe hepatic cirrhosis, the bupropion C<span class=
"Sub">max</span> and AUC were substantially increased (mean
difference: by approximately 70% and 3-fold, respectively) and more
variable when compared to values in healthy volunteers; the mean
bupropion half-life was also longer (29 hours in patients with
severe hepatic cirrhosis vs. 19 hours in healthy subjects). For the
metabolite hydroxybupropion, the mean C<span class="Sub">max</span>
was approximately 69% lower. For the combined amino-alcohol isomers
threohydrobupropion and erythrohydrobupropion, the mean
C<span class="Sub">max</span> was approximately 31% lower. The mean
AUC increased by 28% for hydroxybupropion and 50% for
threo/erythrohydrobupropion. The median T<span class=
"Sub">max</span> was observed 19 hours later for hydroxybupropion
and 21 hours later for threo/erythrohydrobupropion. The mean
half-lives for hydroxybupropion and threo/erythrohydrobupropion
were increased 2- and 4-fold, respectively, in patients with severe
hepatic cirrhosis compared to healthy volunteers (see <a href=

<p><span class="Bold Italics">Renal:</span> There is limited
information on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion in patients with
renal impairment. An inter-study comparison between normal subjects
and patients with end-stage renal failure demonstrated that the
parent drug C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values were
comparable in the 2 groups, whereas the hydroxybupropion and
threohydrobupropion metabolites had a 2.3- and 2.8 fold increase,
respectively, in AUC for patients with end-stage renal failure. A
second study, comparing normal subjects and patients with
moderate-to-severe renal impairment (GFR 30.9 ± 10.8 mL/min) showed
that exposure to a single 150-mg dose of sustained-release
bupropion was approximately 2-fold higher in patients with impaired
renal function while levels of the hydroxybupropion and
threo/erythrohydrobupropion (combined) metabolites were similar in
the 2 groups. The elimination of bupropion and/or the major
metabolites of bupropion may be reduced by impaired renal function
(see <a href="#b9f7de24-a984-4618-b961-21815016c8cd">PRECAUTIONS:
Renal Impairment</a>).</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Left Ventricular Dysfunction:</span>
During a chronic dosing study with bupropion in 14 depressed
patients with left ventricular dysfunction (history of CHF or an
enlarged heart on x-ray), no apparent effect on the
pharmacokinetics of bupropion or its metabolites, compared to
healthy normal volunteers, was revealed.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">Age:</span> The effects of age on the
pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its metabolites have not been
fully characterized, but an exploration of steady-state bupropion
concentrations from several depression efficacy studies involving
patients dosed in a range of 300 to 750 mg/day, on a 3-times-a-day
schedule, revealed no relationship between age (18 to 83 years) and
plasma concentration of bupropion. A single-dose pharmacokinetic
study demonstrated that the disposition of bupropion and its
metabolites in elderly subjects was similar to that of younger
subjects. These data suggest there is no prominent effect of age on
bupropion concentration; however, another pharmacokinetic study,
single and multiple dose, has suggested that the elderly are at
increased risk for accumulation of bupropion and its metabolites
(see <a href="#bced5cbd-5394-45d1-906b-3b6db1f7e98b">PRECAUTIONS:

no sex-related differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of

<h2><span class="Bold">CLINICAL TRIALS</span></h2>
<p class="First">The efficacy of Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) as an aid to smoking cessation
was demonstrated in 3 placebo-controlled, double-blind trials in
nondepressed chronic cigarette smokers (n = 1,940, ≥15 cigarettes
per day). In these studies, Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) was used in conjunction with
individual smoking cessation counseling.</p>
<p>The first study was a dose-response trial conducted at 3
clinical centers. Patients in this study were treated for 7 weeks
with 1 of 3 doses of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release
Tablets, USP (SR) (100, 150, or 300 mg/day) or placebo; quitting
was defined as total abstinence during the last 4 weeks of
treatment (weeks 4 through 7). Abstinence was determined by patient
daily diaries and verified by carbon monoxide levels in expired
air.</p>
<p>Results of this dose-response trial with Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) demonstrated a dose-dependent
increase in the percentage of patients able to achieve 4-week
abstinence (weeks 4 through 7). Treatment with Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) at both 150 and
300 mg/day was significantly more effective than placebo in this
study.</p>
<p>Table 1 presents quit rates over time in the multicenter trial
by treatment group. The quit rates are the proportions of all
persons initially enrolled (i.e., intent-to-treat analysis) who
abstained from week 4 of the study through the specified week.
Treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR) (150 or 300 mg/day) was more effective than placebo in
helping patients achieve 4-week abstinence. In addition, treatment
with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) (7
weeks at 300 mg/day) was more effective than placebo in helping
patients maintain continuous abstinence through week 26 (6 months)
of the study.</p>

<p>The second study was a comparative trial conducted at 4 clinical
centers. Four treatments were evaluated: Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) 300 mg/day, nicotine transdermal
system (NTS) 21 mg/day, combination of Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) 300 mg/day plus NTS 21 mg/day,
and placebo. Patients were treated for 9 weeks. Treatment with
Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) was
initiated at 150 mg/day while the patient was still smoking and was
increased after 3 days to 300 mg/day given as 150 mg twice daily.
NTS 21 mg/day was added to treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) after approximately 1 week when
the patient reached the target quit date. During weeks 8 and 9 of
the study, NTS was tapered to 14 and 7 mg/day, respectively.
Quitting, defined as total abstinence during weeks 4 through 7, was
determined by patient daily diaries and verified by expired air
carbon monoxide levels. In this study, patients treated with any of
the 3 treatments achieved greater 4-week abstinence rates than
patients treated with placebo.</p>

<p>When patients in this study were followed out to one year, the
superiority of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR) and the combination of Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) and NTS over placebo in helping
patients to achieve abstinence from smoking was maintained. The
continuous abstinence rate was 30% (95% CI 24 to 35) in the
patients treated with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release
Tablets, USP (SR), and 33% (95% CI 27 to 39) for patients treated
with the combination at 26 weeks compared with 13% (95% CI 7 to 18)
in the placebo group. At 52 weeks, the continuous abstinence rate
was 23% (95% CI 18 to 28) in the patients treated with Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) and 28% (95% CI 23
to 34) for patients treated with the combination, compared with 8%
(95% CI 3 to12) in the placebo group. Although the treatment
combination of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR) and NTS displayed the highest rates of continuous
abstinence throughout the study, the quit rates for the combination
were not significantly higher (<span class=
"Italics">P</span>&gt;0.05) than for Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) alone.</p>
<p>The comparisons between Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release
Tablets, USP (SR), NTS, and combination treatment in this study
have not been replicated, and, therefore should not be interpreted
as demonstrating the superiority of any of the active treatment
arms over any other.</p>
<p>The third study was a long-term maintenance trial conducted at 5
clinical centers. Patients in this study received open-label
Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) 300
mg/day for 7 weeks. Patients who quit smoking while receiving
Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) (n =
432) were then randomized to Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) 300 mg/day or placebo for a
total study duration of 1 year. Abstinence from smoking was
determined by patient self-report and verified by expired air
carbon monoxide levels. This trial demonstrated that at 6 months,
continuous abstinence rates were significantly higher for patients
continuing to receive Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release
Tablets, USP (SR) than for those switched to placebo (<span class=
"Italics">P</span>&lt;0.05; 55% versus 44%).</p>
<p>Quit rates in clinical trials are influenced by the population
selected. Quit rates in an unselected population may be lower than
the above rates. Quit rates for Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) were similar in patients with
and without prior quit attempts using nicotine replacement
therapy.</p>
<p>Treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR) reduced withdrawal symptoms compared to placebo.
Reductions on the following withdrawal symptoms were most
pronounced: irritability, frustration, or anger; anxiety;
difficulty concentrating; restlessness; and depressed mood or
negative affect. Depending on the study and the measure used,
treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR) showed evidence of reduction in craving for cigarettes or
urge to smoke compared to placebo.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Use In Patients With Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease (COPD):</span> Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) was evaluated in a randomized,
double-blind, comparative study of 404 patients with
mild-to-moderate COPD, defined as FEV1≥35%, FEV1/FVC≤70% and a
diagnosis of chronic bronchitis, emphysema and/or small airways
disease. Patients aged 36 to 76 years were randomized to Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) 300 mg/day (n =
204) or placebo (n = 200) and treated for 12 weeks. Treatment with
Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) was
initiated at 150 mg/day for 3 days while the patient was still
smoking and increased to 150 mg twice daily for the remaining
treatment period. Abstinence from smoking was determined by patient
daily diaries and verified by carbon monoxide levels in expired
air. Quitters are defined as subjects who were abstinent during the
last 4 weeks of treatment. Table 3 shows quit rates in the COPD

<h2><span class="Bold">Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk in
Treating Psychiatric Disorders:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD),
both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their
depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior
(suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they
are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist
until significant remission occurs. Suicide is a known risk of
depression and certain other psychiatric disorders, and these
disorders themselves are the strongest predictors of suicide. There
has been a long-standing concern, however, that antidepressants may
have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence
of suicidality in certain patients during the early phases of
treatment. Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials
of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) showed that these drugs
increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality)
in children, adolescents, and young adults (ages 18-24) with major
depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders.
Short-term studies did not show an increase in the risk of
suicidality with antidepressants compared to placebo in adults
beyond age 24; there was a reduction with antidepressants compared
to placebo in adults aged 65 and older.</p>
<p>The pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials in children and
adolescents with MDD, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), or other
psychiatric disorders included a total of 24 short-term trials of 9
antidepressant drugs in over 4,400 patients. The pooled analyses of
placebo-controlled trials in adults with MDD or other psychiatric
disorders included a total of 295 short-term trials (median
duration of 2 months) of 11 antidepressant drugs in over 77,000
patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality
among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger
patients for almost all drugs studied. There were differences in
absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with
the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences (drug vs
placebo), however, were relatively stable within age strata and
across indications. These risk differences (drug-placebo difference
in the number of cases of suicidality per 1,000 patients treated)
are provided in Table 4.</p>

<p>No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were
suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to
reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.</p>
<p>It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to
longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is
substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in
adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay
the recurrence of depression.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">All patients being treated with
antidepressants for any indication should be monitored
appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening,
suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the
initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose
changes, either increases or decreases.</span></p>
<p>The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks,
insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity,
akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have
been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with
antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other
indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal
link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the
worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses
has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may
represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic
regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in
patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are
experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be
precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if
these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the
patient’s presenting symptoms.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Families and caregivers of patients being
treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other
indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted
about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation,
irritabilit</span>y<span class="Bold">, unusual changes in
behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the
emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately
to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily
observation by families and caregivers</span>. Prescriptions for

<h2><span class="Bold">Screening Patients for Bipolar
Disorder:</span></h2>
<p class="First">A major depressive episode may be the initial
presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though
not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode
with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of
precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for
bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above
represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to
initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with
depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if
they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should
include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history
of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted
that Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) are

<p>Data from a comparative study of Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR), nicotine transdermal system

placebo as an aid to smoking cessation suggest a higher incidence
of treatment-emergent hypertension in patients treated with the
combination of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR) and NTS. In this study, 6.1% of patients treated with the
combination of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR) and NTS had treatment-emergent hypertension compared to
2.5%, 1.6%, and 3.1% of patients treated with Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR), NTS, and placebo,
respectively. The majority of these patients had evidence of
preexisting hypertension. Three patients (1.2%) treated with the
combination of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR) and NTS and 1 patient (0.4%) treated with NTS had study
medication discontinued due to hypertension compared to none of the
patients treated with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release

<p>There is no clinical experience establishing the safety of
Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) in
patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable
heart disease. Therefore, care should be exercised if it is used in
these groups. Bupropion was well tolerated in depressed patients
who had previously developed orthostatic hypotension while
receiving tricyclic antidepressants, and was also generally well
tolerated in a group of 36 depressed inpatients with stable
congestive heart failure (CHF). However, bupropion was associated
with a rise in supine blood pressure in the study of patients with
CHF, resulting in discontinuation of treatment in 2 patients for
exacerbation of baseline hypertension.</p>

pharmacokinetics of bupropion in patients with renal impairment. An
inter-study comparison between normal subjects and patients with
end-stage renal failure demonstrated that the parent drug
C<span class="Sub">max</span> and AUC values were comparable in the
2 groups, whereas the hydroxybupropion and threohydrobupropion
metabolites had a 2.3- and 2.8-fold increase, respectively, in AUC
for patients with end-stage renal failure. A second study,
comparing normal subjects and patients with moderate-to-severe
renal impairment (GFR 30.9 ± 10.8 mL/min) showed that exposure to a
single 150 mg-dose of sustained-release bupropion was approximately
2-fold higher in patients with impaired renal function while levels
of the hydroxybupropion and threo/erythrohydrobupropion (combined)
metabolites were similar in the 2 groups. Bupropion is extensively
metabolized in the liver to active metabolites, which are further
metabolized and subsequently excreted by the kidneys. Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) should be used
with caution in patients with renal impairment and a reduced
frequency of dosing should be considered as bupropion and the

hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 isoenzyme. Therefore, the potential
exists for a drug interaction between Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) and drugs that are substrates of
or inhibitors/inducers of the CYP2B6 isoenzyme (e.g., orphenadrine,
thiotepa, cyclophosphamide, ticlopidine, and clopidogrel). In
addition, <span class="Italics">in vitro</span> studies suggest
that paroxetine, sertraline, norfluoxetine, and fluvoxamine as well
as nelfinavir inhibit the hydroxylation of bupropion. No clinical
studies have been performed to evaluate this finding. The
threohydrobupropion metabolite of bupropion does not appear to be
produced by the cytochrome P450 isoenzymes.</p>
<p>In a series of studies in healthy volunteers, ritonavir (100 mg
twice daily or 600 mg twice daily) or ritonavir 100 mg plus
lopinavir 400 mg (KALETRA) twice daily reduced the exposure of
bupropion and its major metabolites in a dose dependent manner by
approximately 20% to 80%.</p>
<p>Similarly, efavirenz 600 mg once daily for 2 weeks reduced the
exposure of bupropion by approximately 55%. This effect of
ritonavir, KALETRA, and efavirenz is thought to be due to the
induction of bupropion metabolism. Patients receiving any of these
drugs with bupropion may need increased doses of bupropion, but the
maximum recommended dose of bupropion should not be exceeded (see
<a href="#b1cc06a6-6017-4ad6-a87f-22f8c0ba791a">CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY: Metabolism</a>).</p>
<p>Multiple oral doses of bupropion had no statistically
significant effects on the single dose pharmacokinetics of
lamotrigine in 12 healthy volunteers.</p>
<p>Animal data indicated that bupropion may be an inducer of
drug-metabolizing enzymes in humans. However, following chronic
administration of bupropion, 100 mg three times daily to 8 healthy
male volunteers for 14 days, there was no evidence of induction of
its own metabolism. Because bupropion is extensively metabolized,
the coadministration of other drugs may affect its clinical
activity. In particular, certain drugs may induce the metabolism of
bupropion (e.g., carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin), while
other drugs may inhibit the metabolism of bupropion (e.g.,
cimetidine). The effects of concomitant administration of
cimetidine on the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its active
metabolites were studied in 24 healthy young male volunteers.
Following oral administration of two 150-mg Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) with and without 800 mg of
cimetidine, the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its hydroxy
metabolite were unaffected. However, there were 16% and 32%
increases, respectively, in the AUC and C<span class=
"Sub">max</span> of the combined moieties of threohydro- and
erythrohydro- bupropion.</p>

<h3><span class="Bold Italics">Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome
P450IID6 (CYP2D6):</span></h3>
<p class="First">Many drugs, including most antidepressants (SSRIs,
many tricyclics), beta-blockers, antiarrhythmics, and
antipsychotics are metabolized by the CYP2D6 isoenzyme. Although
bupropion is not metabolized by this isoenzyme, bupropion and
hydroxybupropion are inhibitors of the CYP2D6 isoenzyme
<span class="Italics">in vitro</span>. In a study of 15 male
subjects (aged 19 to 35 years) who were extensive metabolizers of
the CYP2D6 isoenzyme, daily doses of bupropion given as 150 mg
twice daily followed by a single dose of 50 mg desipramine
increased the C<span class="Sub">max</span>, AUC, and t<span class=
"Sub">1/2</span> of desipramine by an average of approximately 2-,
5- and 2-fold, respectively. The effect was present for at least 7
days after the last dose of bupropion. Concomitant use of bupropion
with other drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 has not been formally
studied.</p>
<p>Therefore, coadministration of bupropion with drugs that are
metabolized by CYP2D6 isoenzyme including certain antidepressants
(e.g., nortriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, paroxetine,
fluoxetine, sertraline), antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol,
risperidone, thioridazine), beta-blockers (e.g., metoprolol), and
Type 1C antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide), should be
approached with caution and should be initiated at the lower end of
the dose range of the concomitant medication. If bupropion is added
to the treatment regimen of a patient already receiving a drug
metabolized by CYP2D6, the need to decrease the dose of the
original medication should be considered, particularly for those
concomitant medications with a narrow therapeutic index.</p>
<p>Drugs which require metabolic activation by CYP2D6 in order to
be effective (e.g., tamoxifen) theoretically could have reduced
efficacy when administered concomitantly with inhibitors of CYP2D6
such as bupropion.</p>
<p>Although citalopram is not primarily metabolized by CYP2D6, in
one study bupropion increased the C<span class="Sub">max</span> and
AUC of citalopram by 30% and 40%, respectively. Citalopram did not
affect the pharmacokinetics of bupropion and its three
metabolites.</p>
<p><span class="Bold Italics">MAO Inhibitors:</span> Studies in
animals demonstrate that the acute toxicity of bupropion is
enhanced by the MAO inhibitor phenelzine (see <a href=

<p><span class="Bold Italics">Levodopa and Amantadine:</span>
Limited clinical data suggest a higher incidence of adverse
experiences in patients receiving bupropion concurrently with
either levodopa or amantadine. Administration of Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) to patients
receiving either levodopa or amantadine concurrently should be

Physiological changes resulting from smoking cessation itself, with

concomitant medications, which may require dosage adjustment. Blood
concentrations of concomitant medications that are extensively

These doses are approximately 10 and 2 times the maximum
recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively, on a mg/m<span class=

<p>One study has been conducted in pregnant women. This

<h2><span class="Bold">Geriatric Use</span></h2>
<p class="First">Of the approximately 6,000 patients who
participated in clinical trials with bupropion sustained-release
tablets (depression and smoking cessation studies), 275 were 65 and
over and 47 were 75 and over. In addition, several hundred patients
65 and over participated in clinical trials using the
immediate-release formulation of bupropion (depression studies). No
overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed
between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported
clinical experience has not identified differences in responses
between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity
of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.</p>
<p>A single-dose pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that the
disposition of bupropion and its metabolites in elderly subjects
was similar to that of younger subjects; however, another
pharmacokinetic study, single and multiple dose, has suggested that
the elderly are at increased risk for accumulation of bupropion and
its metabolites (see <a href=
"#b7ecddb4-907c-4b7e-87b2-198333599b86">CLINICAL
PHARMACOLOGY</a>).</p>
<p>Bupropion is extensively metabolized in the liver to active
metabolites, which are further metabolized and excreted by the
kidneys. The risk of toxic reaction to this drug may be greater in
patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are
more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken
in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function

<h2><span class="Bold">Other Events Observed During the Clinical
Development and Postmarketing Experience of Bupropion:</span></h2>
<p class="First">In addition to the adverse events noted above, the
following events have been reported in clinical trials and
postmarketing experience with the sustained-release formulation of
bupropion in depressed patients and in nondepressed smokers, as
well as in clinical trials and postmarketing clinical experience
with the immediate-release formulation of bupropion.</p>
<p>Adverse events for which frequencies are provided below occurred
in clinical trials with the sustained-release formulation of
bupropion. The frequencies represent the proportion of patients who
experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event on at least one
occasion in placebo-controlled studies for depression (n = 987) or
smoking cessation (n = 1,013), or patients who experienced an
adverse event requiring discontinuation of treatment in an
open-label surveillance study with bupropion sustained-release
tablets (n = 3,100). All treatment-emergent adverse events are
included except those listed in Tables 5 and 6, those events listed
in other safety-related sections of the outsert, those adverse
events subsumed under COSTART terms that are either overly general
or excessively specified so as to be uninformative, those events
not reasonably associated with the use of the drug, and those
events that were not serious and occurred in fewer than 2
patients.</p>
<p>Events are further categorized by body system and listed in
order of decreasing frequency according to the following
definitions of frequency: Frequent adverse events are defined as
those occurring in at least 1/100 patients. Infrequent adverse
events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, while rare
events are those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients.</p>
<p>Adverse events for which frequencies are not provided occurred
in clinical trials or postmarketing experience with bupropion. Only
those adverse events not previously listed for sustained-release
bupropion are included. The extent to which these events may be
associated with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR) is unknown.</p>

"42227-9"><a name="section-9" id="section-9"></a>
<p class="First">Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR) are likely to have a low abuse potential.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Humans:</span> There have been few reported
cases of drug dependence and withdrawal symptoms associated with
the immediate-release formulation of bupropion. In human studies of
abuse liability, individuals experienced with drugs of abuse
reported that bupropion produced a feeling of euphoria and
desirability. In these subjects, a single dose of 400 mg (1.33
times the recommended daily dose) of bupropion produced mild
amphetamine-like effects compared to placebo on the
Morphine-Benzedrine Subscale of the Addiction Research Center
Inventories (ARCI), which is indicative of euphorigenic properties
and a score intermediate between placebo and amphetamine on the
Liking Scale of the ARCI.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Animals:</span> Studies in rodents and
primates have shown that bupropion exhibits some pharmacologic
actions common to psychostimulants. In rodents, it has been shown
to increase locomotor activity, elicit a mild stereotyped
behavioral response, and increase rates of responding in several
schedule-controlled behavior paradigms. In primate models to assess
the positive reinforcing effects of psychoactive drugs, bupropion
was self-administered intravenously. In rats, bupropion produced
amphetamine- and cocaine-like discriminative stimulus effects in
drug discrimination paradigms used to characterize the subjective
effects of psychoactive drugs.</p>
<p>The possibility that bupropion may induce dependence should be
kept in mind when evaluating the desirability of including the drug
in smoking cessation programs of individual patients.</p>

<li><a href="#">OVERDOSAGE</a>
<div class="Section toggle-content closed" data-sectioncode=
"34088-5"><a name="section-10" id="section-10"></a>
<p class="First"><span class="Bold">Human Overdose
Experience:</span> Overdoses of up to 30 g or more of bupropion
have been reported. Seizure was reported in approximately one-third
of all cases. Other serious reactions reported with overdoses of
bupropion alone included hallucinations, loss of consciousness,
sinus tachycardia, and ECG changes such as conduction disturbances
(including QRS prolongation) or arrhythmias. Fever, muscle
rigidity, rhabdomyolysis, hypotension, stupor, coma, and
respiratory failure have been reported mainly when bupropion was
part of multiple drug overdoses.</p>
<p>Although most patients recovered without sequelae, deaths
associated with overdoses of bupropion alone have been reported in
patients ingesting large doses of the drug. Multiple uncontrolled
seizures, bradycardia, cardiac failure, and cardiac arrest prior to
death were reported in these patients.</p>
<p><span class="Bold">Overdosage Management:</span> Ensure an
adequate airway, oxygenation, and ventilation. Monitor cardiac
rhythm and vital signs. EEG monitoring is also recommended for the
first 48 hours post-ingestion. General supportive and symptomatic
measures are also recommended. Induction of emesis is not
recommended.</p>
<p>Activated charcoal should be administered. There is no
experience with the use of forced diuresis, dialysis,
hemoperfusion, or exchange transfusion in the management of
bupropion overdoses. No specific antidotes for bupropion are
known.</p>
<p>Due to the dose-related risk of seizures with Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR), hospitalization
following suspected overdose should be considered. Based on studies
in animals, it is recommended that seizures be treated with
intravenous benzodiazepine administration and other supportive
measures, as appropriate.</p>
<p>In managing overdosage, consider the possibility of multiple
drug involvement. The physician should consider contacting a poison
control center for additional information on the treatment of any
overdose. Telephone numbers for certified poison control centers
are listed in the <span class="Italics">Physicians’ Desk
Reference</span> (PDR).</p>

<h2><span class="Bold">Usual Dosage for Adults:</span></h2>
<p class="First">The recommended and maximum dose of Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) is 300 mg/day,
given as 150 mg twice daily. Dosing should begin at 150 mg/day
given every day for the first 3 days, followed by a dose increase
for most patients to the recommended usual dose of 300 mg/day.
There should be an interval of at least 8 hours between successive
doses. Doses above 300 mg/day should not be used (see <a href=
"#b4e6b135-9316-405c-9815-9f117f90a4d4">WARNINGS</a>). Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) should be
swallowed whole and not crushed, divided, or chewed, as this may
lead to an increased risk of adverse effects including seizures.
Treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR) should be initiated <span class="Bold">while the patient
is still smoking,</span> since approximately 1 week of treatment is
required to achieve steady-state blood levels of bupropion.
Patients should set a “target quit date” within the first 2 weeks
of treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR), generally in the second week. Treatment with Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) should be
continued for 7 to 12 weeks; longer treatment should be guided by
the relative benefits and risks for individual patients. If a
patient has not made significant progress towards abstinence by the
seventh week of therapy with Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR), it is unlikely that he or she
will quit during that attempt, and treatment should probably be
discontinued. Conversely, a patient who successfully quits after 7
to 12 weeks of treatment should be considered for ongoing therapy
with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR).
Dose tapering of Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR) is not required when discontinuing treatment. It is
important that patients continue to receive counseling and support
throughout treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release
Tablets, USP (SR), and for a period of time thereafter.</p>
</div>
<div class="Section"><a name="section-11.2" id="section-11.2"></a>
<h2><span class="Bold">Individualization of Therapy:</span></h2>
<p class="First">Patients are more likely to quit smoking and
remain abstinent if they are seen frequently and receive support
from their physicians or other healthcare professionals. It is
important to ensure that patients read the instructions provided to
them and have their questions answered. Physicians should review
the patient’s overall smoking cessation program that includes
treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets,
USP (SR). Patients should be advised of the importance of
participating in the behavioral interventions, counseling, and/or
support services to be used in conjunction with Bupropion
Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR). See Medication
Guide at the end of the prescribing information.</p>
<p>The goal of therapy with Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) is complete abstinence. If a
patient has not made significant progress towards abstinence by the
seventh week of therapy with Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR), it is unlikely that he or she
will quit during that attempt, and treatment should probably be
discontinued.</p>
<p>Patients who fail to quit smoking during an attempt may benefit
from interventions to improve their chances for success on
subsequent attempts. Patients who are unsuccessful should be
evaluated to determine why they failed. A new quit attempt should
be encouraged when factors that contributed to failure can be
eliminated or reduced, and conditions are more favorable.</p>

mg/day for maintenance therapy demonstrated that treatment for up
to 6 months was efficacious. Whether to continue treatment with
Bupropion Hydrochloride Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) for
periods longer than 12 weeks for smoking cessation must be
determined for individual patients.</p>

<p class="First">Combination treatment with Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) and NTS may be prescribed for
smoking cessation. The prescriber should review the complete
prescribing information for both Bupropion Hydrochloride
Extended-Release Tablets, USP (SR) and NTS before using combination

<h4>Why is DailyMed no longer displaying pill images on the Search
Results and Drug Info pages?</h4>
<br>
<p>Due to inconsistencies between the drug labels on DailyMed and
the pill images provided by <a href=
"https://rximage.nlm.nih.gov/docs/doku.php?id=rximageapi_support"
target="_blank">RxImage</a>, we no longer display the RxImage pill
images associated with drug labels.</p>
<p>We anticipate reposting the images once we are able identify and
filter out images that do not match the information provided in the
drug labels.</p>

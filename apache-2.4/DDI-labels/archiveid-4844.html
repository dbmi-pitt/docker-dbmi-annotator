<h1>Suicidality in Children and Adolescents</h1>
<p class="First"><span class="bold">Antidepressants increase the
risk of suicidal thinking and behavior (suicidality) in short-term
studies in children and adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder
(MDD) and other psychiatric disorders. Anyone considering the use
of DESYREL or any other antidepressant in a child or adolescent
must balance this risk with the clinical need. Patients who are
started on therapy should be observed closely for clinical
worsening, suicidality, or unusual changes in behavior. Families
and caregivers should be advised of the need for close observation

<h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
<p class="First">DESYREL (trazodone hydrochloride) is an
antidepressant chemically unrelated to tricyclic, tetracyclic, or
other known antidepressant agents. Trazodone hydrochloride is a
triazolopyridine derivative designated as
2-[3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl]-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]pyridin-3(2<span class="underline">H</span>)-one
hydrochloride. It is a white odorless crystalline powder which is
freely soluble in water. Its molecular weight is 408.3. The
empirical formula is C<span class="Sub">19</span>H<span class=
"Sub">22</span>ClN<span class="Sub">5</span>O • HCl and the
structural formula is represented as follows:</p>

alt="Image from Drug Label Content"></div>
<p>DESYREL is supplied for oral administration in 50 mg, 100 mg,
150 mg and 300 mg tablets.</p>
<p>DESYREL Tablets, 150 mg, contain the following inactive
ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, FD&amp;C Yellow No. 6
(aluminum lake), magnesium stearate, pregelatinized starch, and
stearic acid.</p>
<p>DESYREL Tablets, 300 mg, contain the following inactive
ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, yellow ferric oxide,
magnesium stearate, sodium starch glycolate, pregelatinized starch,
and stearic acid.</p>
<a name="section-4" id="section-4"></a>
<h1>CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY</h1>
<p class="First">The mechanism of DESYREL’s antidepressant action
in man is not fully understood. In animals, DESYREL selectively
inhibits serotonin uptake by brain synaptosomes and potentiates the
behavioral changes induced by the serotonin precursor,
5-hydroxytryptophan. Cardiac conduction effects of DESYREL in the
anesthetized dog are qualitatively dissimilar and quantitatively
less pronounced than those seen with tricyclic antidepressants.
DESYREL is not a monoamine oxidase inhibitor and, unlike
amphetamine-type drugs, does not stimulate the central nervous
system.</p>
<a name="section-4.1" id="section-4.1"></a>
<h2>Pharmacokinetics</h2>
<a name="section-4.1.1" id="section-4.1.1"></a>
<h3><span class="bold">Absorption</span></h3>
<p class="First">In humans, DESYREL is well absorbed after oral
administration without selective localization in any tissue. When
DESYREL is taken shortly after ingestion of food, there may be an
increase in the amount of drug absorbed, a decrease in maximum
concentration and a lengthening in the time to maximum
concentration. Peak plasma levels occur approximately one hour
after dosing when DESYREL is taken on an empty stomach or two hours
after dosing when taken with food.</p>
<a name="section-4.1.2" id="section-4.1.2"></a>
<h3><span class="bold">Metabolism</span></h3>
<p class="First"><span class="italics">In vitro</span> studies in
human liver microsomes show that trazodone is metabolized to an
active metabolite, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) by cytochrome
P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). Other metabolic pathways that may be involved in
metabolism of trazodone have not been well characterized.</p>
<a name="section-4.1.3" id="section-4.1.3"></a>
<h3><span class="bold">Elimination</span></h3>
<p class="First">In some patients DESYREL may accumulate in the
plasma.</p>
<a name="section-4.2" id="section-4.2"></a>
<h2>Drug-Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">See also <span class="bold"><a href=
"#section-8.4">PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions</a></span>.
<span class="italics">In vitro</span> drug metabolism studies
reveal that trazodone is a substrate of the cytochrome P450 3A4
(CYP3A4) enzyme and trazodone metabolism can be inhibited by the
CYP3A4 inhibitors ketoconazole, ritonavir, and indinavir. The
effect of short-term administration of ritonavir (200 mg twice
daily, 4 doses) on the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of
trazodone (50 mg) has been studied in 10 healthy subjects. The
C<span class="Sub">max</span> of trazodone increased by 34%, the
AUC increased 2.4-fold, the half-life increased by 2.2-fold, and
the clearance decreased by 52%. Adverse effects including nausea,
hypotension, and syncope were observed when ritonavir and trazodone
were co-administered.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine induces CYP3A4. Following co-administration of
carbamazepine 400 mg/day with trazodone 100 mg to 300 mg daily,
carbamazepine reduced plasma concentrations of trazodone (as well
as mCPP) by 76 and 60%, respectively, compared to pre-carbamazepine
values.</p>
<p>For those patients who responded to DESYREL, one-third of the
inpatients and one-half of the outpatients had a significant
therapeutic response by the end of the first week of treatment.
Three-fourths of all responders demonstrated a significant
therapeutic effect by the end of the second week. One-fourth of
responders required 2–4 weeks for a significant therapeutic
response.</p>
<a name="section-5" id="section-5"></a>
<h1>INDICATIONS AND USAGE</h1>
<p class="First">DESYREL is indicated for the treatment of
depression. The efficacy of DESYREL has been demonstrated in both
inpatient and outpatient settings and for depressed patients with
and without prominent anxiety. The depressive illness of patients
studied corresponds to the Major Depressive Episode criteria of the
American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual, III.<span class="Sup">a</span></p>
<p>Major Depressive Episode implies a prominent and relatively
persistent (nearly every day for at least two weeks) depressed or
dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and
includes at least four of the following eight symptoms: change in
appetite, change in sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation,
loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive,
increased fatigability, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed
thinking or impaired concentration, and suicidal ideation or
attempts.</p>
<a name="section-6" id="section-6"></a>
<h1>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1>
<p class="First">DESYREL is contraindicated in patients
hypersensitive to DESYREL.</p>
<a name="section-7" id="section-7"></a>
<h1>WARNINGS</h1>
<a name="section-7.1" id="section-7.1"></a>
<h2><span class="bold">Clinical Worsening and Suicide
Risk</span></h2>
<p class="First">Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD),
both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their
depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior
(suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they
are taking antidepressant medications, and this risk may persist
until significant remission occurs. There has been a long-standing
concern that antidepressants may have a role in inducing worsening
of depression and the emergence of suicidality in certain patients.
Antidepressants increased the risk of suicidal thinking and
behavior (suicidality) in short-term studies in children and
adolescents with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and other
psychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>Pooled analyses of short-term placebo-controlled trials of 9
antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and others) in children and adolescents
with MDD, OCD, or other psychiatric disorders (a total of 24 trials
involving over 4400 patients) have revealed a greater risk of
adverse events representing suicidal behavior or thinking
(suicidality) during the first few months of treatment in those
receiving antidepressants. The average risk of such events in
patients receiving antidepressants was 4%, twice the placebo risk
of 2%. There was considerable variation in risk among drugs, but a
tendency toward an increase for almost all drugs studied. The risk
of suicidality was most consistently observed in the MDD trials,
but there were signals of risk arising from some trials in other
psychiatric indications (obsessive compulsive disorder and social
anxiety disorder) as well. <span class="bold">No suicides occurred
in any of these trials</span>. It is unknown whether the
suicidality risk in pediatric patients extends to longer-term use,
i.e., beyond several months. It is also unknown whether the
suicidality risk extends to adults.</p>
<p><span class="bold">All pediatric patients being treated with
antidepressants for any indication should be observed closely for
clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior,
especially during the initial few months of a course of drug
therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or
decreases. Such observation would generally include at least weekly
face-to-face contact with patients or their family members or
caregivers during the first 4 weeks of treatment, then every other
week visits for the next 4 weeks, then at 12 weeks, and as
clinically indicated beyond 12 weeks. Additional contact by
telephone may be appropriate between face-to-face
visits.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Adults with MDD or co-morbid depression in
the setting of other psychiatric illness being treated with
antidepressants should be observed similarly for clinical worsening
and suicidality, especially during the initial few months of a
course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either
increases or decreases.</span></p>
<p>The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks,
insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity,
akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have
been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with
antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other
indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal
link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the
worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses
has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may
represent precursors to emerging suicidality.</p>
<p>Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic
regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in
patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are
experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be
precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if
these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the
patient's presenting symptoms.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Families and caregivers of pediatric patients
being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or
other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be
alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of
agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other
symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality,
and to report such symptoms immediately to health care providers.
Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and
caregivers.</span> Prescriptions for DESYREL should be written for
the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient
management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose. Families and
caregivers of adults being treated for depression should be
similarly advised.</p>
<a name="section-7.2" id="section-7.2"></a>
<h2>Screening Patients for Bipolar Disorder</h2>
<p class="First">A major depressive episode may be the initial
presentation of bipolar disorder. It is generally believed (though
not established in controlled trials) that treating such an episode
with an antidepressant alone may increase the likelihood of
precipitation of a mixed/manic episode in patients at risk for
bipolar disorder. Whether any of the symptoms described above
represent such a conversion is unknown. However, prior to
initiating treatment with an antidepressant, patients with
depressive symptoms should be adequately screened to determine if
they are at risk for bipolar disorder; such screening should
include a detailed psychiatric history, including a family history
of suicide, bipolar disorder, and depression. It should be noted
that DESYREL is not approved for use in treating bipolar
depression.</p>
<p>TRAZODONE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE OCCURRENCE OF PRIAPISM.
IN MANY OF THE CASES REPORTED, SURGICAL INTERVENTION WAS REQUIRED
AND, IN A SOME OF THESE CASES, PERMANENT IMPAIRMENT OF ERECTILE
FUNCTION OR IMPOTENCE RESULTED. MALE PATIENTS WITH PROLONGED OR
INAPPROPRIATE ERECTIONS SHOULD IMMEDIATELY DISCONTINUE THE DRUG AND
CONSULT THEIR PHYSICIAN.</p>
<p>The detumescence of priapism and drug-induced penile erections
has been accomplished by both pharmacologic, e.g., the
intracavernosal injection of alpha-adrenergic stimulants such as
epinephrine and norepinephrine, as well as surgical
procedures.<span class="Sup">b-g</span> Any pharmacologic or
surgical procedure utilized in the treatment of priapism should be
performed under the supervision of a urologist or a physician
familiar with the procedure and should not be initiated without
urologic consultation if the priapism has persisted for more than
24 hours.</p>
<p>DESYREL (trazodone hydrochloride) is not recommended for use
during the initial recovery phase of myocardial infarction.</p>
<p>Caution should be used when administering DESYREL to patients
with cardiac disease, and such patients should be closely
monitored, since antidepressant drugs (including DESYREL) have been
associated with the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias. Recent
clinical studies in patients with pre-existing cardiac disease
indicate that DESYREL may be arrhythmogenic in some patients in
that population. Arrhythmias identified include isolated PVCs,
ventricular couplets, and in two patients short episodes (3–4
beats) of ventricular tachycardia.</p>
<a name="section-8" id="section-8"></a>
<h1>PRECAUTIONS</h1>
<a name="section-8.1" id="section-8.1"></a>
<h2>General</h2>
<p class="First">The possibility of suicide in seriously depressed
patients is inherent in the illness and may persist until
significant remission occurs. Therefore, prescriptions should be
written for the smallest number of tablets consistent with good
patient management.</p>
<p>Hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope, has
been reported to occur in patients receiving DESYREL. Concomitant
administration of antihypertensive therapy with DESYREL may require
a reduction in the dose of the antihypertensive drug.</p>
<p>Little is known about the interaction between DESYREL and
general anesthetics; therefore, prior to elective surgery, DESYREL
should be discontinued for as long as clinically feasible.</p>
<p>As with all antidepressants, the use of DESYREL should be based
on the consideration of the physician that the expected benefits of
therapy outweigh potential risk factors.</p>
<a name="section-8.2" id="section-8.2"></a>
<h2>Information for Patients</h2>
<p class="First">Prescribers or other health professionals should
inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the
benefits and risks associated with treatment with DESYREL and
should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication
Guide About Using Antidepressants in Children and Teenagers is
available for DESYREL. The prescriber or health professional should
instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the
Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its
contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the
contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any
questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide
is reprinted at the end of this document.</p>
<p>Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to
alert their prescriber if these occur while taking DESYREL.</p>
<a name="section-8.2.1" id="section-8.2.1"></a>
<h3>Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk:</h3>
<p class="First">Patients, their families, and their caregivers
should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety,
agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility,
aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness),
hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of
depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during
antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down.
Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to observe
for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since
changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the
patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are
severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's
presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with
an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a
need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the
medication.</p>
<a name="section-8.2.2" id="section-8.2.2"></a>
<p class="First">Because priapism has been reported to occur in
patients receiving DESYREL, patients with prolonged or
inappropriate penile erection should immediately discontinue the
drug and consult with the physician (see <span class=
"bold"><a href="#section-7">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<p>Antidepressants may impair the mental and/or physical ability
required for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks, such
as operating an automobile or machinery; the patient should be
cautioned accordingly.</p>
<p>DESYREL may enhance the response to alcohol, barbiturates, and
other CNS depressants.</p>
<p>DESYREL should be given shortly after a meal or light snack.
Within any individual patient, total drug absorption may be up to
20% higher when the drug is taken with food rather than on an empty
stomach. The risk of dizziness/lightheadedness may increase under
fasting conditions.</p>
<a name="section-8.3" id="section-8.3"></a>
<h2>Laboratory Tests</h2>
<p class="First">Occasional low white blood cell and neutrophil
counts have been noted in patients receiving DESYREL. These were
not considered clinically significant and did not necessitate
discontinuation of the drug; however, the drug should be
discontinued in any patient whose white blood cell count or
absolute neutrophil count falls below normal levels. White blood
cell and differential counts are recommended for patients who
develop fever and sore throat (or other signs of infection) during
therapy.</p>
<a name="section-8.4" id="section-8.4"></a>
<h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
<p class="First"><span class="italics">In vitro</span> drug
metabolism studies suggest that there is a potential for drug
interactions when trazodone is given with CYP3A4 inhibitors.
Ritonavir, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increased the C<span class=
"Sub">max</span>, AUC, and elimination half-life, and decreased
clearance of trazodone after administration of ritonavir twice
daily for 2 days. Adverse effects including nausea, hypotension,
and syncope were observed when ritonavir and trazodone were
co-administered. It is likely that ketoconazole, indinavir, and
other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole or nefazodone may lead
to substantial increases in trazodone plasma concentrations, with
the potential for adverse effects. If trazodone is used with a
potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, a lower dose of trazodone should be
considered.</p>
<p>Carbamazepine reduced plasma concentrations of trazodone when
co-administered. Patients should be closely monitored to see if
there is a need for an increased dose of trazodone when taking both
drugs.</p>
<p>Increased serum digoxin or phenytoin levels have been reported
to occur in patients receiving DESYREL concurrently with either of
those two drugs.</p>
<p>It is not known whether interactions will occur between
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors and DESYREL. Due to the absence
of clinical experience, if MAO inhibitors are discontinued shortly
before or are to be given concomitantly with DESYREL, therapy
should be initiated cautiously with gradual increase in dosage
until optimum response is achieved.</p>
<a name="section-8.5" id="section-8.5"></a>
<h2>Therapeutic Interactions</h2>
<p class="First">Concurrent administration with electroshock
therapy should be avoided because of the absence of experience in
this area.</p>
<p>There have been reports of increased and decreased prothrombin
time occurring in warfarinized patients who take DESYREL.</p>
<a name="section-8.6" id="section-8.6"></a>
<h2>Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility</h2>
<p class="First">No drug- or dose-related occurrence of
carcinogenesis was evident in rats receiving DESYREL in daily oral
doses up to 300 mg/kg for 18 months.</p>
<a name="section-8.7" id="section-8.7"></a>
<h2>Pregnancy Category C</h2>
<p class="First">DESYREL has been shown to cause increased fetal
resorption and other adverse effects on the fetus in two studies
using the rat when given at dose levels approximately 30–50 times
the proposed maximum human dose. There was also an increase in
congenital anomalies in one of three rabbit studies at
approximately 15–50 times the maximum human dose. There are no
adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. DESYREL
should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit
justifies the potential risk to the fetus.</p>
<a name="section-8.8" id="section-8.8"></a>
<h2>Nursing Mothers</h2>
<p class="First">DESYREL and/or its metabolites have been found in
the milk of lactating rats, suggesting that the drug may be
secreted in human milk. Caution should be exercised when DESYREL is
administered to a nursing woman.</p>
<a name="section-8.9" id="section-8.9"></a>
<h2>Pediatric Use</h2>
<p class="First">Safety and effectiveness in the pediatric
population have not been established (see <span class=
"bold"><a href="#section-2">BOX WARNING</a></span> and <span class=
"bold"><a href="#section-7.1">WARNINGS—Clinical Worsening and
Suicide Risk</a></span>).</p>
<p>Anyone considering the use of DESYREL in a child or adolescent
must balance the potential risks with the clinical need.</p>
<a name="section-9" id="section-9"></a>
<h1>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h1>
<p class="First">Because the frequency of adverse drug effects is
affected by diverse factors (e.g., drug dose, method of detection,
physician judgment, disease under treatment, etc.) a single
meaningful estimate of adverse event incidence is difficult to
obtain. This problem is illustrated by the variation in adverse
event incidence observed and reported from the inpatients and
outpatients treated with DESYREL. It is impossible to determine
precisely what accounts for the differences observed.</p>
<a name="section-9.1" id="section-9.1"></a>
<h2>Clinical Trial Reports</h2>
<p class="First">The table below is presented solely to indicate
the relative frequency of adverse events reported in representative
controlled clinical studies conducted to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of DESYREL<span class="Sup">®</span> (trazodone
hydrochloride).</p>
<p>The figures cited cannot be used to predict precisely the
incidence of untoward events in the course of usual medical
practice where patient characteristics and other factors often
differ from those which prevailed in the clinical trials. These
incidence figures, also, cannot be compared with those obtained
from other clinical studies involving related drug products and
placebo as each group of drug trials is conducted under a different
set of conditions.</p>

<p>Occasional sinus bradycardia has occurred in long-term
studies.</p>
<p>In addition to the relatively common (i.e., greater than 1%)
untoward events enumerated above, the following adverse events have
been reported to occur in association with the use of
DESYREL<span class="Sup">®</span> (trazodone hydrochloride) in the
controlled clinical studies: akathisia, allergic reaction, anemia,
chest pain, delayed urine flow, early menses, flatulence,
hallucinations/delusions, hematuria, hypersalivation, hypomania,
impaired speech, impotence, increased appetite, increased libido,
increased urinary frequency, missed periods, muscle twitches,
numbness, and retrograde ejaculation.</p>
<a name="section-9.2" id="section-9.2"></a>
<h2>PostIntroduction Reports</h2>
<p class="First">Although the following adverse reactions have been
reported in DESYREL users, the causal association has neither been
confirmed nor refuted.</p>
<p>Voluntary reports received since market introduction include the
following: abnormal dreams, agitation, alopecia, anxiety, aphasia,
apnea, ataxia, breast enlargement or engorgement, cardiospasm,
cerebrovascular accident, chills, cholestatis, clitorism,
congestive heart failure, diplopia, edema, extrapyramidal symptoms,
grand mal seizures, hallucinations, hemolytic anemia, hirsutism,
hyperbilirubinemia, increased amylase, increased salivation,
insomnia, leukocytosis, leukonychia, jaundice, lactation, liver
enzyme alterations, methemoglobinemia, nausea/vomiting (most
frequently), paresthesia, paranoid reaction, priapism (See
<span class="bold"><a href="#section-7">WARNINGS</a></span> and
<span class="bold"><a href="#section-8.2">PRECAUTIONS</a></span>,
<span class="bold"><a href="#section-8.2">Information for
Patients</a></span>; some patients have required surgical
intervention), pruritus, psoriasis, psychosis, rash, stupor,
inappropriate ADH syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, unexplained death,
urinary incontinence, urinary retention, urticaria, vasodilation,
vertigo and weakness.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular system effects which have been reported include
the following: conduction block, orthostatic hypotension and
syncope, palpitations, bradycardia, atrial fibrillation, myocardial
infarction, cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, and ventricular ectopic
activity, including ventricular tachycardia (see <span class=
"bold"><a href="#section-7">WARNINGS</a></span>).</p>
<a name="section-10" id="section-10"></a>
<h1>OVERDOSAGE</h1>
<a name="section-10.1" id="section-10.1"></a>
<h2>Animal Oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span></h2>
<p class="First">The oral LD<span class="Sub">50</span> of the drug
is 610 mg/kg in mice, 486 mg/kg in rats, and 560 mg/kg in
rabbits.</p>
<a name="section-10.2" id="section-10.2"></a>
<h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
<p class="First">Death from overdose has occurred in patients
ingesting DESYREL (trazodone hydrochloride) and other drugs
concurrently (namely, alcohol; alcohol + chloral hydrate +
diazepam; amobarbital; chlordiazepoxide; or meprobamate).</p>
<p>The most severe reactions reported to have occurred with
overdose of DESYREL alone have been priapism, respiratory arrest,
seizures, and EKG changes. The reactions reported most frequently
have been drowsiness and vomiting. Overdosage may cause an increase
in incidence or severity of any of the reported adverse reactions
(see <span class="bold"><a href="#section-9">ADVERSE
REACTIONS</a></span>).</p>
<a name="section-10.3" id="section-10.3"></a>
<h2>Treatment</h2>
<p class="First">There is no specific antidote for DESYREL.
Treatment should be symptomatic and supportive in the case of
hypotension or excessive sedation. Any patient suspected of having
taken an overdose should have the stomach emptied by gastric
lavage. Forced diuresis may be useful in facilitating elimination
of the drug.</p>
<a name="section-11" id="section-11"></a>
<h1>DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION</h1>
<p class="First">The dosage should be initiated at a low level and
increased gradually, noting the clinical response and any evidence
of intolerance. Occurrence of drowsiness may require the
administration of a major portion of the daily dose at bedtime or a
reduction of dosage. DESYREL should be taken shortly after a meal
or light snack. Symptomatic relief may be seen during the first
week, with optimal antidepressant effects typically evident within
two weeks. Twenty-five percent of those who respond to DESYREL
require more than two weeks (up to four weeks) of drug
administration.</p>
<a name="section-11.1" id="section-11.1"></a>
<h2>Usual Adult Dosage</h2>
<p class="First">An initial dose of 150 mg/day in divided doses is
suggested. The dose may be increased by 50 mg/day every three to
four days. The maximum dose for outpatients usually should not
exceed 400 mg/day in divided doses. Inpatients (i.e., more severely
depressed patients) may be given up to but not in excess of 600
mg/day in divided doses.</p>
<a name="section-11.2" id="section-11.2"></a>
<h2>Maintenance</h2>
<p class="First">Dosage during prolonged maintenance therapy should
be kept at the lowest effective level. Once an adequate response
has been achieved, dosage may be gradually reduced, with subsequent
adjustment depending on therapeutic response.</p>
<p>Although there has been no systematic evaluation of the efficacy
of DESYREL beyond six weeks, it is generally recommended that a
course of antidepressant drug treatment should be continued for
several months.</p>

<p><span class="bold">About Using Antidepressants in Children and
Teenagers</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">What is the most important information I
should know if my child is being prescribed an
antidepressant?</span></p>
<p>Parents or guardians need to think about 4 important things when
their child is prescribed an antidepressant:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a risk of suicidal thoughts or actions</li>
<li>How to try to prevent suicidal thoughts or actions in your
child</li>
<li>You should watch for certain signs if your child is taking an
antidepressant</li>
<li>There are benefits and risks when using antidepressants</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bold">1. There is a Risk of Suicidal Thoughts or
Actions</span></p>
<p>Children and teenagers sometimes think about suicide, and many
report trying to kill themselves.</p>
<p>Antidepressants increase suicidal thoughts and actions in some
children and teenagers. But suicidal thoughts and actions can also
be caused by depression, a serious medical condition that is
commonly treated with antidepressants. Thinking about killing
yourself or trying to kill yourself is called <span class=
"italics">suicidality</span> or <span class="italics">being
suicidal</span>.</p>
<p>A large study combined the results of 24 different studies of
children and teenagers with depression or other illnesses. In these
studies, patients took either a placebo (sugar pill) or an
antidepressant for 1 to 4 months. <span class="bold italics">No one
committed suicide in these studies,</span> but some patients became
suicidal. On sugar pills, 2 out of every 100 became suicidal. On
the antidepressants, 4 out of every 100 patients became
suicidal.</p>
<p><span class="bold">For some children and teenagers, the risk of
suicidal actions may be especially high</span>. These include
patients with</p>
<ul>
<li>Bipolar illness (sometimes called manic-depressive
illness)</li>
<li>A family history of bipolar illness</li>
<li>A personal or family history of attempting suicide</li>
</ul>
<p>If any of these are present, make sure you tell your healthcare
provider before your child takes an antidepressant.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2. How to Try to Prevent Suicidal Thoughts
and Actions</span></p>
<p>To try to prevent suicidal thought and actions in your child,
pay close attention to changes in her or his moods or actions,
especially if the changes occur suddenly. Other important people in
your child’s life can help by paying attention as well (e.g., your
child, brothers and sisters, teachers, and other important people).
The changes to look out for are listed in Section 3, on what to
watch for.</p>
<p>Whenever an antidepressant is started or its dose is changed,
pay close attention to your child.</p>
<p>After starting an antidepressant, your child should generally
see his or her healthcare provider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Once a week for the first 4 weeks</li>
<li>Every 2 weeks for the next 4 weeks</li>
<li>After taking the antidepressant for 12th weeks</li>
<li>After 12 weeks, follow your healthcare provider’s advice about
how often to come back</li>
<li>More often if problems or questions arise (see Section 3)</li>
</ul>
<p>You should call your child’s healthcare provider between visits
if needed.</p>
<p><span class="bold">3. You Should Watch For Certain Signs If Your
Child is Taking an Antidepressant</span></p>
<p>Contact your child’s healthcare provider <span class=
"bold italics">right away</span> if your child exhibits any of the
following signs for the first time, or if they seem worse, or worry
you, your child, or your child’s teacher:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thoughts about suicide or dying</li>
<li>Attempts to commit suicide</li>
<li>New or worse depression</li>
<li>New or worse anxiety</li>
<li>Feeling very agitated or restless</li>
<li>Panic attacks</li>
<li>Difficulty sleeping (insomnia)</li>
<li>New or worse irritability</li>
<li>Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent</li>
<li>Acting on dangerous impulses</li>
<li>An extreme increase in activity and talking</li>
<li>Other unusual changes in behavior or mood</li>
</ul>
<p>Never let your child stop taking an antidepressant without first
talking to his or healthcare provider. Stopping an antidepressant
suddenly can cause other symptoms.</p>
<p><span class="bold">4. There are Benefits and Risks When Using
Antidepressants</span></p>
<p>Antidepressants are used to treat depression and other
illnesses. Depression and other illnesses can lead to suicide. In
some children and teenagers, treatment with an antidepressant
increases suicidal thinking or actions. It is important to discuss
all the risks of treating depression and also the risks of not
treating it. You and your child should discuss all treatment
choices with your healthcare provider, not just the use of
antidepressants.</p>
<p>Other side effects can occur with antidepressants (see section
below).</p>
<p>Of all antidepressants, only fluoxetine (Prozac<span class=
"Sup">®</span>) has been FDA approved to treat pediatric
depression.</p>
<p>For obsessive compulsive disorder in children and teenagers, FDA
has approved only fluoxetine (Prozac<span class="Sup">®</span>),
sertraline (Zoloft<span class="Sup">®</span>), fluvoxamine, and
clomipramine (Anafranil<span class="Sup">®</span>).</p>
<p>Your healthcare provider may suggest other antidepressants based
on the past experience of your child or other family members.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Is this all I need to know if my child is
being prescribed an antidepressant?</span></p>
<p>No. This is a warning about the risk for suicidality. Other side
effects can occur with antidepressants. Be sure to ask your
healthcare provider to explain all the side effects of the
particular drug he or she is prescribing. Also ask about drugs to
avoid when taking an antidepressant. Ask your healthcare provider
or pharmacist where to find more information.</p>
